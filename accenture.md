Technical Requirements and Infrastructure: These requirements complement functional requirements and define how the system should behave. They are also known as non-functional requirements (NFRs).

Role of Architects: Capturing technical requirements is usually the responsibility of architects, done in cooperation with the client.

Prioritizing Requirements: It's important to clarify priorities for the system, as perfection in every aspect is expensive and often not possible.

User Experience and Security: For Digital Health, usability and reliability are crucial, but security is a top priority due to the sensitivity of health information.
 

Influence on Project: Technical requirements influence the work of programmers and testers to ensure an improved user experience.

Architecture Design: The task involves understanding the client's technical requirements and designing the architecture accordingly. This can involve creating new designs or building on existing systems.

Reviewing Work: A common task in software development is to review the work of colleagues to ensure quality.

Improving User Experience: The focus is on improving the user experience for booking a doctor's appointment, which has been identified as a problematic area.

Peer Review: The task includes performing a peer review of a colleague's suggestion for an integration plan with a partner hospital, identifying any missed details.



Cloud Architecture: The page discusses the importance of cloud architecture for Digital Health, highlighting the benefits of using cloud infrastructure over owning physical hardware.

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Digital Health can lease hardware from a cloud service provider, allowing them to scale their computing power based on demand and only pay for what they use.

Platform as a Service (PaaS): Cloud providers offer advanced services beyond just hardware, such as databases that don't require installation or maintenance by the user.



Project Overview: Heidi, the Head of the Security Advisory team, has assigned you to work as a Security Analyst on a project with Digital Health. The goal is to enhance their app's user experience while ensuring its security.

Security Focus: The project involves securing various components, including data storage in the cloud, code accessibility for programmers, and maintaining security during system testing.

Assessment Approach   :Heidi and the team have decided to conduct a security maturity assessment based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to understand Digital Health's current security maturity level.


The page provides an overview of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, which is a set of guidelines for managing and improving cybersecurity practices. Here are the main points:

Five Functions: The framework is divided into five main functions:

Identify: Taking inventory of assets and potential risks.

Protect: Implementing safeguards to protect critical assets.

Detect: Setting up systems to identify security issues.

Respond: Analyzing and addressing security incidents.

Recover: Restoring normal operations after an incident.


Maturity Levels: The framework includes five maturity levels to gauge cybersecurity effectiveness:

Tier 0: No tools or processes in place.

Tier 1: Ad-hoc and individual knowledge-based practices.

Tier 2: Informal and scattered processes.

Tier 3: Documented and company-wide processes.

Tier 4: Advanced and continuously improving practices.



Securing Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) in an Agile Environment: The goal is to integrate security into the software development lifecycle for a holistic and proactive approach to security.

Understanding Agile Development: Agile development emphasizes iterative development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between cross-functional teams.

Iterative Cycles: Agile projects are divided into sprints, typically 2-4 weeks long, during which specific features are developed and tested.

Collaboration: Frequent communication between team members, including developers, testers, and stakeholders, ensures alignment and quick resolution of issues.

Flexibility: Agile allows for changes to be made quickly in response to feedback or new requirements.
